# Erosion
A crate to plot Fourier curves and Functions

## Function
Functions are a list of bounded polynomials

### Bounded Polynomials

Bounded polynomials are polynomials valid between a user defined domain

### Polynomials

Polynomials are simply a list of terms

### Terms

Terms are a structure defined 'coef * x ^pow'

## Curves

### FourierCurve

A list of curves

### Curve

a curve is defined in the form 'mag * sin(fre * x + phase)'
